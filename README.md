## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]
Hello, my name is KUAN-I LEE and my student ID is 104064510. I'm currently a new member of NVLab in NTHU, a lab which dedicated to image processing. Since I'm totally a freshman for now, still trying to get my head around CV's stuff. That is, a noob and fool, yet looking to be good and cool.

## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]
It is indeed my duty to devote myself into image processing related subjects and resources. Also, this lecture is quite well reputed and recommended by most of former lessons participants. So why not?

## What do you want to achieve in the course? [ max 500 words]
I hope to have a clear understanding of computer vision basics, getting a in depth look at modern CV theorems and experiments. In the end, hope to have ability to implement researches into practice.

## Due Date: Sept. 23, 2015
