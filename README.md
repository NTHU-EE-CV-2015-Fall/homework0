#homework0
This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]
My name is Yen-Chen Lin, I am currently a senior student in NTHU CS department but I also work as a freelancer.
I love programming very much especially functional programming, and most of my days are spent writing Objective-C, Swift and Python.
Recently, I am working super hard to enhance my Machine Learning background in order to build some exciting projects in the future.
## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]
The robots are coming and I believe their presence will eventually bridge the digital-physical divide, dramatically impacting human life.
In Robotics development, Computer Vision plays an really important role to make robots understand their environment and make decision.
Therefore, I really want to learn Computer Vision especially topics about tracking & SLAM.
## What do you want to achieve in the course? [ max 500 words]
I've seen a really interesting project related to Computer Vision built by SnapChat.
Here's the link: https://www.facebook.com/teepr/videos/vb.1433215316907826/1711091172453571/?type=2&theater
I'm looking forward to combine my mobile development skills and Computer Vision knowledge to rebuild this exciting project from scratch!
PS. 中文 or English are both fine.
