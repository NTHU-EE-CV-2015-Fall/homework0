This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]
I am Kuo-Hao Zeng(曾國豪), the TA in this class. I am a second year graduated student in National Tsing Hua University. My interesting research topic is mainly about computer vision and I am a member of VSLab now.

## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]
I think the furture world must be filled with a lot of bots! And the most important issue of those is how they perceive the world, how they understand the world, and of course how they realize the human beings! I consider that "vision" is a big topic of this so I want to learn the deep technique, comprehensive knowledge, solid understanding in this domain.

## What do you want to achieve in the course? [ max 500 words]
Lean good knowledge with everybody!
