This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]
I am 廖仲文, a senior student majoring in Electrical Engineering in NTHU. I am from Hsinchu, so I have spent most of my life here so far. Within all the fields of study in EE, I am mostly interested in visual processing and embedded system. Aside from these academic interests, I also love music and singing. I am a member in an a capella group arranged by a few students from EE department as well. In my spare time, I like to watch American TV series. I love to explore different ways of thinking from different cultures, and thus I am preparing to study abroad in pursuit of a graduate degree.

## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]
I find programming and DSP fascinating from my experience in NTHUEE. Due to the multiple interesting and visionary applications of Computer Vision, I expect to learn the basic concepts and knowledge in this area. Moreover, I am considering Computer Vision as my future field of study, and now doing a project about wearable camera and object recognition with professor Sun Min.

## What do you want to achieve in the course? [ max 500 words]
I hope to learn the central idea of Computer Vision and some basic visual processing techniques through the programming projects in this course. I am also looking forward to obtain some machine learning concepts.
