This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]

Hello everyone. I'm Meng-Jiun Chiou, a senior student of NCTU ECE. I'm not sure if I'm the only NCTU student joining this lecture, however I hope to get involved with you happily. I haven't found my teammate yet, so I'll appreciate if anyone could let me in. Although I'm ECE student, I am rather interested in CS so that I have attended some fundamental classes of CS. My hobby is jogging, table tennis and watching Japan dramas and animations.

## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]

My objective of attending this lecture is learning comprehensive about computer vision. I'd been an exchange student at Aizawa-Yamasaki Lab, the University of Tokyo for one year (2014/10-2015/9). In the year, I'd learned knowledge about computer vision, especially in generic object recognition. I conducted a experiment about acclerating object recognition by bag-of-features (bag-of-visual-words) using the patches of pictures. Using matlab codes and framework of ScSPM (J. Yang, CVPR'09), I learned how to implement the whole experiment from raw pictures to the classification result using dataset Caltech101/256. As my experiment, I feeled interested in computer vision, therefore I chose to take this course to learn more comprehensively about it.

## What do you want to achieve in the course? [ max 500 words]

I would like to learn and implement some famous technique of computer vision by myself. For example, the inside process of SIFT (feature detection and extraction), the whole process of clustering algorithm (e.g. K-means) and training classifier (e.g. SVM). Maybe by implementing them by myself I could learn much more. In addition, creating an amazing final project is also an objective, while I don't have any idea for now.
