This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

## Brief self-introduction
I'm David, study in NTHU EE as a senior. As a college student, I take this course not for graduating point, but to fullfill my curiousity of computer vision and machine learning. Though I choose EE, I feel that computer science is more attracting to me. I may go to the system A after graduate, which I think is a balance between my interest in CS and EE.

## Why Computer Vision?
Since I wrote my first hello world, I consider AI the subtlest thing a computer scientest can do (and also the most frightening). However, AI is a big field, so I choose machine learning and computer vision as an entrance to it. I've taken several courses about them and also watched lectures on the Internet. I also take 吳尚鴻's machine learning class this semester.
If one day a computer could live and think like we human do, I wish I can be the one that gives him vision.

## What do you want to achieve in the course? 
I will take professor 李夢麟's project this year, which contains digital signal processing and computer vision. The goal is to locate veins in human's arms simply by the pulse, instead of X-ray or ultra sound.
Hopefully, the course can help me on the project, and enable me to go further.
