This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]

Hi everyone, I'm Hou-Ning Hu, currently studying a master degree of NTHU EE, and I'm delighted to be a member of VSLab. My major in CCU is Computer Engineering, or more precisely, drone control and computer vision.  

I love travelling, sports, cuisine, and sometimes not playing by the rules.   
Furthermore, It's just a second nature for me to challenge myself on new tasks, new environ., unfamiliar languages.  

## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]

"A machine/computer could receive a vision of their surroundings, and this can make our daily life better."  
"It's definitely cool." After a computer vision course, I thought.   

Thus, my graduate project was about UAV and computer vision. Soon, the success of my project kept me digging into CV.
And I am here, as a apprentice of CV, I believe computer vision is a chef's Choice in decades, and I want to be a chef someday.  


## What do you want to achieve in the course? [ max 500 words]

I'll go as far as I can see, I really expect myself can see farther.  
I want to learn more about computer vision so I could have more "wands" fighting against harder problems.  
And, of course, I'm looking forward to be a great "wand seller" after this course.  



PS. 中文 or English are both fine.
