This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]

My name is Yang-Jiun Lin. I'm the freshman of the Graduate Institute of Electrical Engineering, NTHU. I'm fond of photography, 
usually retouching photos I take. Because of this hobby, I'm interested in image processing. However, I'm not good at programing. Maybe it's difficult for me to pass the course, but I think that I can go through the test in the end by always keeping an enthusiastic attitude to the course.    

## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]

Actually there's nothing to tell, Computer Vision is bound up with image processing.

## What do you want to achieve in the course? [ max 500 words]



PS. 中文 or English are both fine.
