This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]
 老師好呀~ 我是林嘉文實驗室的碩一新生。
## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]
 身為影像的小菜鳥，老師的CV一定要朝聖的課堂!
## What do you want to achieve in the course? [ max 500 words]
剛從通訊組跳槽到影像處理領域，希望可以在修完此門課後，對此存有的不只是興趣以及專業。
PS. 中文 or English are both fine.
