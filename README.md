This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

## Brief self-introduction 
Hi!
My name is Yueh-yun,Li.I am a graduate student in national tsing hua university now. 

## Why Computer Vision? 
Computer vision is one of major topics in my lab, VCSlab.I am interested in how human can deal with visions after I attended DSP courses and special project course,although there's too much mathematics in CV technology that I am not good at.Hope I can get more knowledge about CV after this semester.

## What do you want to achieve in the course? 
After taking a glance at Computer vision,written by Szeliski,I am getting more interested in computer vision.This book is too hard and too unrealistic for me to understand by myself,so I attend this course.I hope there's more view points to understand the meanings behind matrices computations, and I can understand how the real world can be thought by computer,such as how projection product and how feature matching eachother,ect.
One more thing,I hope I can enhence coding abilities.
